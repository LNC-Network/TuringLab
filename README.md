# 🧠 TuringLab

> **TuringLab** is an open platform where you can connect **non-LLM machine learning models** (like classifiers, regressors, or custom models) with **LLMs of your choice** — allowing you to **talk to your ML models through natural language**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

TuringLab bridges the gap between traditional ML models and modern LLMs.  
You can plug in your **custom-trained models**, add an **LLM backend** (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or local ones), and start **interacting with your models conversationally**.

We use the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to make LLMs act as intelligent agents that can:
- Understand user queries
- Route them to your ML models
- Interpret and summarize results
- Maintain conversational context

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🔗 **Bring Your Own Model** — Add any scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch model.  
- 💬 **LLM Bridge** — Connect any LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.) to talk to your models.  
- 🤖 **MCP-Powered Agents** — Enable dynamic communication between LLM and your ML model.  
- 🧠 **Multi-Model Orchestration** — Connect multiple ML models and interact with them seamlessly.  
- ⚙️ **Extensible API** — Expose models through unified APIs and SDKs.  
- 🧾 **Logging & Insights** — Track interactions and analyze responses.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LNC-Network/TuringLab.git
cd TuringLab
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3️⃣ Add Your Models

Put your ML models (like `.pkl`, `.onnx`, or `.pt` files) in the `/models` directory and register them in the config file:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "spam_classifier",
      "path": "./models/spam.pkl",
      "type": "sklearn"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4️⃣ Connect an LLM

Add your LLM API key in `.env`:

```env
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Agent

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## 💡 Example Use

**User:** “Classify this message: *‘Win a free iPhone!’*”
**TuringLab:** “That looks like spam (Confidence: 94%).”

**User:** “Why?”
**TuringLab:** “The model found multiple spam-related keywords and a high promotional tone.”
